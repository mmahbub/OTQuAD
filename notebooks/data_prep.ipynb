Recurrent variants were established to be de novo in nine cases and shown to affect highly conserved residues within the lamin ɑ-helical rod domain, likely disrupting interactions required for higher-order assembly of lamin filaments.CONCLUSION: We identify dominant pathogenic variants in LMNB1 and LMNB2 as a genetic cause of primary microcephaly, implicating a major structural component of the nuclear envelope in its etiology and defining a new form of laminopathy. The distinct nature of this lamin B-associated phenotype highlights the strikingly different developmental requirements for lamin paralogs and suggests a novel mechanism for primary microcephaly warranting future investigation.'},\n",

All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability.'},\n",

We then evaluated all individuals in the original and a second cohort for rare or novel variants in ABCC8 and identified 11 additional heterozygous predicted damaging ABCC8 variants. ABCC8 encodes SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1)-a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We observed loss of ATP-sensitive potassium channel function for all ABCC8 variants evaluated and pharmacological rescue of all channel currents in vitro by the SUR1 activator, diazoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare missense variants in ABCC8 are associated with PAH.

The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss.

We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08\\u2009×\\u200910(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.'},\n",

Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.'},\n",

       "     'context': \"Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis is imperative. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 11 patients with both CNS and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of UM data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs.\"},\n",

Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels. When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification. Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.'},\n",

The statistics is used to assess the significance of an over-representation of miRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters based on the statistical significance associated with each miRNA-target interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to infer possible evidences of miRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of the miRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise analysis of the individual components.CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the miRNA-target interactions.

       "     'context': \"Publicly available RNA-seq data is routinely used for retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology. Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA-seq data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a '2-Step' approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq data sets, we developed a novel '1-Step' approach named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA-seq data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of PRAM to mouse hematopoietic RNA-seq data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene Pik3cg implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human. PRAM is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package.\"},\n",

       "     'context': 'Sequence logos have been widely used as graphical representations of conserved nucleic acid and protein motifs. Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.'},\n",

       "     'context': 'signatureSearch is an R/Bioconductor package that integrates a suite of existing and novel algorithms into an analysis environment for gene expression signature (GES) searching combined with functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results. In a typical GES search (GESS), a query GES is searched against a database of GESs obtained from large numbers of measurements, such as different genetic backgrounds, disease states and drug perturbations. Database matches sharing correlated signatures with the query indicate related cellular responses frequently governed by connected mechanisms, such as drugs mimicking the expression responses of a disease. To identify which processes are predominantly modulated in the GESS results, we developed specialized FEA methods combined with drug-target network visualization tools. The provided analysis tools are useful for studying the effects of genetic, chemical and environmental perturbations on biological systems, as well as searching single cell GES databases to identify novel network connections or cell types. The signatureSearch software is unique in that it provides access to an integrated environment for GESS/FEA routines that includes several novel search and enrichment methods, efficient data structures, and access to pre-built GES databases, and allowing users to work with custom databases.'},\n",

Cardiac cath from 0/18/05, which was performed at the Adli Corn11 Health Center, showed a 95% ostial LAD lesion, a 60% mid LAD lesion, an 80% distal LAD lesion, a 70% proximal D1 lesion, a 40% proximal circumflex lesion, a 90% ostial OM1 lesion, a 100% proximal RCA lesion, and a right dominant circulation. Echo from 4/26/05 showed a 60% ejection fraction, with trace to mild mitral regurgitation, no wall motion abnormalities. An EKG on 0/18/05 showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 52, inverted T waves in V3, V4, V5 and V6. A chest x-ray from 4/27/05 was read out as normal. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to Surgery on 2/11/05. The preoperative diagnosis was unstable angina, three-vessel disease and morbid obesity. The procedure was a CABG x3. The patient had an anaphylactoid response to aprotinin and subsequently had an all vein CABG. There was a Y graft, SVG1 connecting SVG2 to the LAD, SVG2 connecting the aorta to OM1, and SVG3 connecting to PDA. The patient was brought up from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. He was extubated on postoperative day #1. He did well over the next several days. He had some intermittent confusion, but neuro exam was essentially nonfocal, and the patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #4. At that time, neurologically, he was intact. Of note, he had a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the operating room because of the aprotinin reaction in the operating room with systolic pressures in the 40s. Open cardiac massage was required, and he was defibrillated. They used lidocaine and amiodarone during the code. His CK-MB rose to 37.5, and his CK was 1646. After his procedure, the patient did wake up and was neurologically intact. The patient was on a regular diet. He had had problems with abdominal distention, but this had resolved. The patient had also been noted to have an increased creatinine. However, this also resolved. The patient was a known diabetic and was on NovoLog sliding scale, and also receiving Lantus. The patient has no infectious disease issues at that time. The patient was in the Step-Down Unit, and on postoperative day #5, he was noted to spike. Cultures were sent off which grew out 3+ Gram-native rods. He was started on Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia. He also is noted to have a positive UTI and was started on levofloxacin at that time. He also was noted to have a rise in his creatinine and this was followed as well. On postoperative day #8, the patient was again spiked up to 101. Pancultures were sent out as well. He was found to have a beta-lactamase-resistant E. coli in his urine. This prompted an ID consult, and the patient was started on nitrofurantoin. Also, at this time, around postoperative day #9, it was noted that the patient began to have some serous drainage from his sternal wound. He was followed by Infectious Disease at that time, and over the course of the next several days, it was discovered that the wound grew out Gram-negative rods. A Plastic Surgery consult was obtained for the patient after a CT scan showed some nonunion of the sternal table and collection of fluid underneath the sternum. On postoperative day #11, it was decided that the patient would benefit from incision and drainage plus pectoral flap or omental flap for sternal wound infection, so the patient was taken back to the operating room on 6/29/05 for incision and drainage of a deep sternal wound infection. At the time of surgery, a purulent liquid material was expressed through the skin. The incision was made. The sternum was noted to be totally separated with most of the wires having been pulled through. The wound was irrigated, and an omental flap with pectoral advancement was performed. The patient returned from the operating room to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit where he was again confused, however, was able to be easily returned to baseline. Following these recommendations, the nitrofurantoin was discontinued and the patient was started on imipenem. Also, the patient was noted to be growing Enterobacter in his urine and he was started no ceftazidime. The patient did well in the ICU. He improved from a neuro status. His chest wound healed without difficulty. He had one brief episode of atrial fibrillation during a coughing spell, but this also resolved, and the patient was continued on his antihypertensive medication. The patient was deemed fit for transfer on a postoperative day #18 back from the ICU once again to the Step-Down Unit. SUMMARY BY SYSTEM: 1. Neurologically, the patient is Spanish-speaking only. He is intact, moving all extremities, getting in and out of bed, and very independent. 2. Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is in 70 to 80, sinus. Blood pressure is 100s to 150s, means are 70s to 100s. He is on Lopressor 25 mg q.6h. and on amlodipine 5 mg b.i.d. 3. Respiratory: The patient is on room air, saturating 98%. 4. GI: The patient is advanced diet as tolerated, having bowel movements, on a diabetic diet. 5. Renal: The patient's Foley is out, running negative 340 for the day before, on Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Recommendations would be to have an extra dose or so of Lasix since chest x-ray this morning was noted to be slightly wet. 6. Endocrine: He is a diabetic. He is on Lantus, NovoLog, insulin, and Diabetes Management is following. 7. Heme: The patient is on aspirin and atorvastatin. He still has chest drains, which are being followed by Plastics who wants to keep them in. 8. ID: He has got a deep sternal infection with E. coli and is status post a pectus as well as a omental flap closure. Imipenem was started on 2/22/05 per ID's recommendation, needs to continue for six weeks. UTI growing out Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Imipenem was stared on 2/22/05, again, this will need to be continued for six weeks. The patient is also on vancomycin for his sternal wound infection. This was started on 6/29/05 and needs to continue for six weeks. Currently, the patient is afebrile. White blood cell count is 10. The chest wound was noted to have a small area of erythema, however, it is intact, and he is being followed by Plastics. The rest of the dictation will follow when the patient is discharged. eScription document: 6-3812703 EMS Dictated By: WESTERMEIER, SIMON Attending: BERLINGHOF, WINFRED Dictation ID 3963571 D: 10/9/05 T: 10/9/05 [report end]\",\n",
