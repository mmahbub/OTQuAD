The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

By August 2013, the VA  deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) requirements to all Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs) with the aim of ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner. The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone). Some symptoms of withdrawal such as dysphoria, insomnia and prolonged craving may take longer. Patients with chronic pain may find that symptoms, such as fatigue, mental functioning, pain, and well-being, improve over time."

Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone). Some symptoms of withdrawal such as dysphoria, insomnia and prolonged craving may take longer. Patients with chronic pain may find that symptoms, such as fatigue, mental functioning, pain, and well-being, improve over time."

In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period.

In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period. Rates of continuation in Veterans, based on this study, appeared to be related to age, marital status, race,  geography, mental health comorbidity, and dosage. Compared to others, those who were aged 50-65 years,  were married, were of a race other than African American, and who lived in a rural setting were more likely to continue using opioids. Veterans on higher doses of opioids were more likely to continue their use.  Notably, those with mental health diagnoses were less likely to continue opioids, including those with schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses."

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics.

At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy.

If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

An example of the rapid taper is given below. During the first day in the rapid taper, 33% reduction of morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD consists of 60 mg SR (15 mg x 4) Q8h. The subsequent daily dosage for the rapid taper is 45 mg SR (15 mg x 3) Q8h for day 2, 30 mg SR (15 mg x 2) Q8h for day 3, 15 mg SR Q8h for day 4, 15 mg SR Q12h for day 5-7, 15 mg SR QHS for day 8-11. Stop rapid tapering after day 11 and may consider morphine IR 15 mg \u00bd tablet (7.5 mg) twice daily."

If there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies). If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable). During a follow-up, assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions (e.g., medical, mental health, and/or SUD); complete risk mitigation strategies; review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. The factors that increase risks of OT are non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral. If these factors are present, then consider one or more of the following: shortening prescribing interval, intensifying risk mitigation strategies, increasing intensity of monitoring, referring to interdisciplinary care and consulting with or referring to specialty care. If the factors that increase risks of OT are not present, then see if there are indications to discontinue or taper. If there are indications to discontinue or taper, then taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation. If there are no indications to discontinue or taper, then reassess in 1-3 months or more frequently as determined by patient risk factors."

During a follow-up, assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions (e.g., medical, mental health, and/or SUD); complete risk mitigation strategies; review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. The factors that increase risks of OT are non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral. If these factors are present, then consider one or more of the following: shortening prescribing interval, intensifying risk mitigation strategies, increasing intensity of monitoring, referring to interdisciplinary care and consulting with or referring to specialty care. If the factors that increase risks of OT are not present, then see if there are indications to discontinue or taper. If there are indications to discontinue or taper, then taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation. If there are no indications to discontinue or taper, then reassess in 1-3 months or more frequently as determined by patient risk factors."

If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran\u2019s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community."

Elements of the biopsychosocial pain interview include a pain-related history, assessment of pertinent  medical and psychiatric comorbidities including personal and family history of SUD, functional status and  functional goals, coping strategies, and a variety of psychosocial factors such as the patient\u2019s beliefs and  expectations about chronic pain and its treatment. Patients with chronic pain may also experience  worsened quality of life, mental health, immune system function, physical function, sleep, employment  status, and impaired personal relationships. Worsening of some of these factors (e.g., quality of  life, change in employment status) seems to also be associated with pain severity and the presence of  psychiatric comorbidities. Patients with chronic pain report psychological complaints (e.g.,  depression, anxiety, poor self-efficacy, poor general emotional functioning) more often than patients  without chronic pain. Further, there can be social and psychological consequences such as decreased  ability to successfully maintain relationship and career roles and increased depression, fear, and anxiety as  a result of pain."

The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment.

The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep.
