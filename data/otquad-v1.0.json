Prior to any changes being made in opioid prescribing, a discussion should occur between the Veteran, family members/caregivers, and the provider either during a face-to-face appointment or on the telephone. The strategies that will help in the transition are discussion, asking about goals, educating the veteran. Discussion includes listening to the Veteran\u2019s story, letting the Veteran know that you believe that their pain is real, using Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to acknowledge the Veteran\u2019s fears about tapering. Include family members or other supporters in the discussion. Asking about goals includes drawing out their goals for life, having the Veteran fill out the PHI, asking how we can support them during the taper. The drawn-out life goals should not be just being pain-free. PHI is the Personal Health Inventory.  "

The subsequent monthly dosage for the slowest taper is 75 mg SR qam, 75 mg noon, 90 mg qpm for month 2; 75 mg SR (60 mg+15 mg) Q8h for month 3; 75 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm for month 4; 60 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm for month 5; 60 mg SR Q8h for month 6; 60 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm for month 7; 45 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm for month 8; 45 mg SR Q8h for month 9.

Rapid tapers can cause withdrawal effects and patients should be treated with adjunctive medications to minimize these effects; may need to consider admitting the patient for inpatient care. If patients are prescribed both long-acting and short-acting opioids, the decision about which formulation to be tapered first should be individualized based on medical history, mental health diagnoses, and patient preference. Data shows that overdose risk is greater with long-acting preparations. In rapid taper, reduce opioid by 20 to 50% of first dose if needed, then reduce by 10 to 20% every day.

Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment.

The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep.
