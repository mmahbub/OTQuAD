Examples of severe unmanageable adverse effects are drowsiness, constipation, and cognitive impairment. Examples of dosage that indicate high risk of adverse events are doses of 90 MEDD (Morphine equivalent daily dose) and higher. Examples of unsafe behaviors are early refills, lost/stolen prescription, buying or borrowing opioids, failure to obtain or aberrant UDT. "

Prior to any changes being made in opioid prescribing, a discussion should occur between the Veteran, family members/caregivers, and the provider either during a face-to-face appointment or on the telephone. The strategies that will help in the transition are discussion, asking about goals, educating the veteran. Discussion includes listening to the Veteran\u2019s story, letting the Veteran know that you believe that their pain is real, using Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to acknowledge the Veteran\u2019s fears about tapering. Include family members or other supporters in the discussion. Asking about goals includes drawing out their goals for life, having the Veteran fill out the PHI, asking how we can support them during the taper. The drawn-out life goals should not be just being pain-free. PHI is the Personal Health Inventory.  "

Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia.

Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep.

The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Tizanidine is as follows: 4 mg three times daily, can increase to 8 mg three times daily."

If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable). Assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions. Complete risk mitigation strategies. Review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. Complications or co-occurring conditions can be medical, mental health, and/or SUD. Assess if the factors that increase risks of OT are present (e.g., non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral). If the factors that increase risks of OT are present, then consider one or more of the following: shortening prescribing interval, intensifying risk mitigation strategies, increasing intensity of monitoring, referring to interdisciplinary care and consulting with or referring to specialty care. If the factors that increase risks of OT are not present, then see if there are indications to discontinue or taper. If there are indications to discontinue or taper, then taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation. If there are no indications to discontinue or taper, then reassess in 1-3 months or more frequently as determined by patient risk factors."

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. Expanded care team includes registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, and mental health provider. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage."

If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. Expanded care team includes registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, and mental health provider. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage."

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. Expanded care team includes registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, and mental health provider. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage."
