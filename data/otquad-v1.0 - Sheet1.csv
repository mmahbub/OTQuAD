Pain Management Opioid Taper Decision Tool,"When formulating an opioid taper plan, determine if the initial goal is a dose reduction or complete discontinuation. If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran’s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose.

Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

Module A: Determination of Appropriateness for Opioid Therapy,"Module A is about determination of appropriateness for opioid therapy. Note: Non-pharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic therapies are preferred for chronic pain. If a patient is with chronic pain and has been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then proceed to module D. If a patient is with chronic pain and has not been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then obtain biopsychosocial assessment. Then educate or re-educate on non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment. Then implement and optimize non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical, psychological, and complementary and integrative treatments). If the treatments are effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then exit algorithm; manage with non-opioid modalities. If the treatments are not effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then complete opioid risk assessment and see if patient risks outweigh benefits by considering strength and number of risk factors and patient preference. If patient risk outweighs benefits, then see whether referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated (e.g., mental health, SUD, more intensive interdisciplinary care). If referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated, then refer/consult with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments. If referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is not indicated, then see if the patient is willing to engage in a comprehensive pain care plan. Also when referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated, then after referral/consultation with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments, see if the patient is willing to engage in a comprehensive pain care plan.

If the patient is willing to engage in a comprehensive pain care plan, then educate the patient and family about treatment options, including education on known risks and unknown long-term benefits of OT, risks of SUD and overdose, need for risk mitigation strategies, naloxone rescue. Then see if adding OT to comprehensive pain therapy is indicated at this time. If adding OT to comprehensive pain therapy is indicated at this time, then see if the patient is prepared to accept responsibilities and the provider is prepared to implement risk mitigation strategies. If adding OT to comprehensive pain therapy is not indicated at this time, then exit algorithm; manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient is prepared to accept responsibilities and the provider is prepared to implement risk mitigation strategies, then discuss and complete written informed consent with patient and family, determine and document treatment plan, and proceed to module B.

Module B: Treatment with Opioid Therapy,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan. Initiate OT for short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total). Use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe. A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. Long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals. Consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl. Assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects. Offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND).

Module B: Treatment with Opioid Therapy,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan. Initiate OT for short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total). Use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe. A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. Long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals. Consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl. Assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects. Offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND).

Module B: Treatment with Opioid Therapy,"Necessary risk mitigation strategies are OEND, UDT, PDMP, face-to-face follow-up with frequency determined by risk. Indications for tapering and discontinuation are as follows: risks of OT outweigh benefits, patient preference, diversion. Risks of opioid therapy outweigh benefits when there is lack of clinically meaningful improvement in function, concomitant use of medications that increase risk of overdose, co-occurring medical or mental health conditions that increase risk, concerns about OUD or other SUD, patient con-compliance with opioid safety measures and opioid risk mitigation strategies, patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan, prescribed dose higher than the maximal recommended dose, pain condition not effectively treated with opioids (e.g., back pain with normal MRI; fibromyalgia), medical or mental health comorbidities that increase risk, improvement in the underlying pain condition being treated, unmanageable side effects. Factors that may indicate need for more frequent follow-up are non-adherence to comprehensive pain care plan, unexpected UDT and PDMP results, non-adherence to opioid prescription, higher risk medication characteristics, patients with mental health, medical, or SUD comorbidities that increase risk for adverse outcomes. A factor that can help identify non-adherence to a comprehensive pain care plan can be attendance at appointments.

Module C: Tapering or Discontinuation of Opioid Therapy,"Module C is on tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy. If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training.

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is  no evidence of diversion, then look for high risk or dangerous behavior. High risk or dangerous behavior includes overdose events, accidents, and threatening providers. If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation, or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated, exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the following: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. See if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”) or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting. Consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

Paradigm Shift in Pain and Its Treatment,"A paradigm shift in the use of OT for chronic non-terminal pain has paralleled this transformation in pain  care. Prior to the 1980s, OT was rarely used outside of severe acute injury or post-surgical pain, primarily due to concern for tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. As the hospice and palliative care  movement began defining end-of-life care in the U.S. during the 1980s and emphasizing the importance of  pain relief, OT increasingly became a mainstay for cancer and end-of-life pain. Efforts to destigmatize the use of prescription opioids for chronic non-terminal pain encompassed primary care providers and the  public. The efforts led to an unprecedented increase in opioid prescribing for chronic non-terminal pain.  Chronic pain management became synonymous with LOT in the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s  with significant numbers of patients in pain clinics receiving LOT. Despite the absence of long-term safety or efficacy data, OT for chronic non-terminal pain became a mainstay of therapy. However, as observational and epidemiologic data of harm from LOT accumulated, a much more cautious approach to  OT for chronic non-terminal pain has emerged in the decade of the 2010s.",What happened concurrently with the transformation in pain care?,A paradigm shift in the use of OT for chronic non-terminal pain,,,,
