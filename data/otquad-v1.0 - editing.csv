Pain Management Opioid Taper Decision Tool,"Short-term oral medications can be utilized to assist with managing the withdrawal symptoms, especially when prescribing fast tapers. Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

Module A: Determination of Appropriateness for Opioid Therapy,"Module A is about determination of appropriateness for opioid therapy. Note: Non-pharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic therapies are preferred for chronic pain. If a patient is with chronic pain and has been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then proceed to module D. If a patient is with chronic pain and has not been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then obtain biopsychosocial assessment. Then educate or re-educate on non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment. Then implement and optimize non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical, psychological, and complementary and integrative treatments). If the treatments are effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then exit algorithm; manage with non-opioid modalities. If the treatments are not effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then complete opioid risk assessment and see if patient risks outweigh benefits by considering strength and number of risk factors and patient preference. If patient risk outweighs benefits, then see whether referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated (e.g., mental health, SUD, more intensive interdisciplinary care). If referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated, then refer/consult with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments. Then after referral/consultation with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments, see if the patient is willing to engage in a comprehensive pain care plan.

Module B: Treatment with Opioid Therapy,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. If a patient is medically or psychiatrically unstable, then admit/provide medical and psychiatric treatment to stabilize as indicated. If a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable, then see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors. If there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies). If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable). During a follow-up, assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions (e.g., medical, mental health, and/or SUD); complete risk mitigation strategies; review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. The factors that increase risks of OT are non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral.

Module B: Treatment with Opioid Therapy,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. If a patient is medically or psychiatrically unstable, then admit/provide medical and psychiatric treatment to stabilize as indicated. If a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable, then see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors.

If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

This approach coupled with the evidence of both the safety and efficacy for non-pharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic pain therapies has led to the  current transformation in the way in which pain is viewed and treated. The biopsychosocial model of pain recognizes pain as a complex multidimensional experience that requires multimodal and integrated care approaches.

The CDC guideline,  similar to the VA/DoD OT CPG, covered topics including initiation and continuation of OT, management of  OT, and risk assessment and use of risk mitigation strategies. It also used the GRADE system to assign a  grade for the strength for each recommendation which includes assessment of the quality of the evidence and consideration of the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, patient values and preferences,  and other considerations (e.g., resource use, equity) during recommendation development.

Epidemiology and Impact: General Population,"Chronic pain is among the most common, costly, and disabling chronic medical conditions in the U.S. In the U.S., approximately 100 million adults experience chronic pain, and pain is associated with  approximately 20% of ambulatory primary care and specialty visits. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the proportion of pain visits during which patients  received opioids has increased significantly, as have opioid-related morbidity, mortality, overdose death,  and SUD treatment admissions. Approximately one in five patients with non-cancer pain or pain related diagnoses is prescribed opioids in office-based settings.

Epidemiology and Impact: VA/DoD Population ,"From fiscal years 2004 to 2012, the prevalence of opioid prescriptions among Veterans increased from  18.9% to 33.4%, an increase of 76.7%. The groups with the highest prevalence of opioid use were women and young adults (i.e., 18-34 years old). In a sample of non-treatment-seeking members of the military who were interviewed within three months of returning from Afghanistan, 44% reported chronic pain and  15% reported using opioids—percentages much higher than in the general population. Chronic pain was also associated with poorer physical function, independent of comorbid mental health concerns in  Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period.

Chronic Pain and Co-occurring Conditions ,"Individuals with conditions that result in or co-occur with chronic pain may have different needs or respond to treatment differently than individuals with chronic pain alone. Many different physical and psychological conditions have a pain component that can be difficult to distinguish from the underlying mechanism of illness. Furthermore, the treatment of co-occurring pain and other conditions may vary or require special considerations during their management.

Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes of Opioid Therapy ,"The risk factors with the greatest impact on the development of opioid-related adverse events are the duration and dose of opioid analgesic use. Beyond duration and dose of OT, many factors increase the risk of adverse outcomes and must be considered prior to initiating or continuing OT (Box 1). Given the insufficient evidence of benefit for LOT, the clinician must carefully weigh harms and benefits and educate the patient as well as his or her family or caregiver prior to proceeding with treatment. As patient values and preferences may be impacted by other clinical considerations, some patients with one or more risk factors for adverse outcomes may differ with the clinician’s assessment that the risks of OT  outweigh the potential for modest short-term benefits. Thus, it is important to consider patients’ values and concerns, address misconceptions, express empathy, and fully explain to patients with one or more risk factors that they may not benefit from, and may even be harmed by, treatment with OT. Conditions that significantly increase the risk of adverse outcomes from LOT are listed below. Patients for whom LOT is initiated should be carefully monitored, and ongoing assessment of risk should be performed with vigilance for the development of additional risk factors and adverse outcomes (see Recommendations  7-9). Consider consultation with appropriate specialty care providers if there is uncertainty about whether the benefits of OT, such as improved function (e.g., return-to-work), outweigh the risks.
