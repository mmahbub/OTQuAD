Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy. The alternative OUD treatment is extended-release (ER) injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol). MAT can be provided in a variety of treatment settings including residential SUD treatment, intensive outpatient SUD treatment, regular SUD specialty care clinic, primary care or general mental health clinic, or federally regulated opioid treatment program. Moral injury is an act of transgression that leads to serious inner conflict typically brought on by betrayal, disproportionate violence, incidents involving civilians, within-rank violence. For moral injury, treatment via psychologists or chaplains is available. Central sensitization (e .g., fibromyalgia, chronic headaches, and likely many other types of complex chronic pain). Some examples of medical complications are lung disease, hepatic disease, renal disease, or fall risk. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder."

A Veteran with high risk due to a medical condition may have decompensation during the taper and may require a clinic visit over telephone follow-up. If there are issues with the Veteran obtaining outside prescriptions or they are displaying other aberrant behaviors during the taper, providing follow-up in a clinic visit may be more optimal than a telephone visit.

Risks of opioid therapy outweigh benefits when there is lack of clinically meaningful improvement in function, concomitant use of medications that increase risk of overdose, co-occurring medical or mental health conditions that increase risk, concerns about OUD or other SUD, patient con-compliance with opioid safety measures and opioid risk mitigation strategies, patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan, prescribed dose higher than the maximal recommended dose, pain condition not effectively treated with opioids (e.g., back pain with normal MRI; fibromyalgia), medical or mental health comorbidities that increase risk, improvement in the underlying pain condition being treated, unmanageable side effects. Factors that may indicate need for more frequent follow-up are non-adherence to comprehensive pain care plan, unexpected UDT and PDMP results, non-adherence to opioid prescription, higher risk medication characteristics, patients with mental health, medical, or SUD comorbidities that increase risk for adverse outcomes. A factor that can help identify non-adherence to a comprehensive pain care plan can be attendance at appointments.

Prior to the 1980s, OT was rarely used outside of severe acute injury or post-surgical pain, primarily due to concern for tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. As the hospice and palliative care  movement began defining end-of-life care in the U.S. during the 1980s and emphasizing the importance of  pain relief, OT increasingly became a mainstay for cancer and end-of-life pain. Efforts to destigmatize the use of prescription opioids for chronic non-terminal pain encompassed primary care providers and the  public. The efforts led to an unprecedented increase in opioid prescribing for chronic non-terminal pain.  Chronic pain management became synonymous with LOT in the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s  with significant numbers of patients in pain clinics receiving LOT. Despite the absence of long-term safety or efficacy data, OT for chronic non-terminal pain became a mainstay of therapy. However, as observational and epidemiologic data of harm from LOT accumulated, a much more cautious approach to  OT for chronic non-terminal pain has emerged in the decade of the 2010s."

Risks of opioid therapy outweigh benefits when there is lack of clinically meaningful improvement in function, concomitant use of medications that increase risk of overdose, co-occurring medical or mental health conditions that increase risk, concerns about OUD or other SUD, patient con-compliance with opioid safety measures and opioid risk mitigation strategies, patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan, prescribed dose higher than the maximal recommended dose, pain condition not effectively treated with opioids (e.g., back pain with normal MRI; fibromyalgia), medical or mental health comorbidities that increase risk, improvement in the underlying pain condition being treated, unmanageable side effects. Factors that may indicate need for more frequent follow-up are non-adherence to comprehensive pain care plan, unexpected UDT and PDMP results, non-adherence to opioid prescription, higher risk medication characteristics, patients with mental health, medical, or SUD comorbidities that increase risk for adverse outcomes. A factor that can help identify non-adherence to a comprehensive pain care plan can be attendance at appointments. Examples of non-adherence to opioid prescription include using more than prescribed and/or running out late. Higher risk medication can be high-dose opioids, combination of opioids and benzodiazepines. MEDD refers to morphine equivalent daily dose; MRI refers to magnetic resonance imaging; OEND refers to Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution."

The follow-up during the slowest, slower, and faster tapering can be done in the clinic and/or over telephone. The follow-up during the rapid tapering can be done in the hospital, clinic or over telephone. Providers will need to determine whether a telephone or in-clinic appointment is appropriate based on the risk category of the Veteran. A Veteran with high risk due to a medical condition may have decompensation during the taper and may require a clinic visit over telephone follow-up. If there are issues with the Veteran obtaining outside prescriptions or they are displaying other aberrant behaviors during the taper, providing follow-up in a clinic visit may be more optimal than a telephone visit.

The biopsychosocial model of pain recognizes pain as a complex multidimensional experience that requires multimodal and integrated care approaches. Within this context, non-pharmacologic treatments and non-opioid medications are the preferred treatments for chronic non-terminal pain. OT has a limited role, primarily in the treatment of severe acute pain, post-operative pain, and end-of-life pain.  "

Prior to the 1980s, OT was rarely used outside of severe acute injury or post-surgical pain, primarily due to concern for tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. As the hospice and palliative care  movement began defining end-of-life care in the U.S. during the 1980s and emphasizing the importance of  pain relief, OT increasingly became a mainstay for cancer and end-of-life pain. Efforts to destigmatize the use of prescription opioids for chronic non-terminal pain encompassed primary care providers and the  public. The efforts led to an unprecedented increase in opioid prescribing for chronic non-terminal pain.  Chronic pain management became synonymous with LOT in the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s  with significant numbers of patients in pain clinics receiving LOT. Despite the absence of long-term safety or efficacy data, OT for chronic non-terminal pain became a mainstay of therapy. However, as observational and epidemiologic data of harm from LOT accumulated, a much more cautious approach to  OT for chronic non-terminal pain has emerged in the decade of the 2010s."

The subsequent daily dosage for the rapid taper is 45 mg SR (15 mg x 3) Q8h for day 2, 30 mg SR (15 mg x 2) Q8h for day 3, 15 mg SR Q8h for day 4, 15 mg SR Q12h for day 5-7, 15 mg SR QHS for day 8-11. Stop rapid tapering after day 11 and may consider morphine IR 15 mg \u00bd tablet (7.5 mg) twice daily."

A Veteran with high risk due to a medical condition may have decompensation during the taper and may require a clinic visit over telephone follow-up. If there are issues with the Veteran obtaining outside prescriptions or they are displaying other aberrant behaviors during the taper, providing follow-up in a clinic visit may be more optimal than a telephone visit. Follow up on patient function, pain intensity, sleep, physical activity, personal goals, and stress level."

Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy. The alternative OUD treatment is extended-release (ER) injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol).

Data shows that overdose risk is greater with long-acting preparations. In rapid taper, reduce opioid by 20 to 50% of first dose if needed, then reduce by 10 to 20% every day.

The strategies that will help in the transition are discussion, asking about goals, educating the veteran. Discussion includes listening to the Veteran\u2019s story, letting the Veteran know that you believe that their pain is real, using Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to acknowledge the Veteran\u2019s fears about tapering. Include family members or other supporters in the discussion. Asking about goals includes drawing out their goals for life, having the Veteran fill out the PHI, asking how we can support them during the taper.

If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran\u2019s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community."
